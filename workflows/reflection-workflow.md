# Reflection Workflow

This workflow should be used in conjunction with the [Task Management Guidelines](../shared/task-management.md) for reviewing completed tasks and capturing learnings.

This document outlines the recommended process for conducting a thorough reflection upon task completion. Reflection is a critical practice for continuous improvement, capturing learnings, and refining workflows.

## Purpose of Reflection

The reflection process serves multiple purposes:

1. **Knowledge Capture:** Document what was learned during the task execution
2. **Process Improvement:** Identify workflow inefficiencies and opportunities for enhancement
3. **Quality Assurance:** Review the deliverables against requirements
4. **Knowledge Transfer:** Create artifacts that help others learn from the experience
5. **Team Growth:** Build a culture of continuous improvement and learning

## When to Conduct Reflection

Reflection should be conducted in the following situations:

- Upon completion of a significant feature or component
- At the end of a project milestone
- When a sprint concludes
- After addressing a critical bug or production issue
- When new approaches or technologies were used
- Whenever process pain points were encountered

## Reflection Process

### 1. Preparation

Before the reflection session:

- **Gather Artifacts:**
  - All related GitHub issues and their complete history
  - Pull requests and their review comments
  - Commit history
  - Documentation created or updated
  - Any metrics or performance data related to the task

- **Review Timeline:**
  - Initial estimates vs. actual time spent
  - Key decision points and pivot moments
  - Blockers encountered and how they were resolved

- **Invite Participants:**
  - Core contributors to the task
  - Stakeholders who can provide valuable perspective
  - Team members who will work on similar tasks in the future

### 2. The Reflection Discussion

Structure the reflection conversation around these key areas:

#### 2.1. Task Outcomes Review

- **Goal Achievement:**
  - Were all the acceptance criteria met?
  - How closely does the implementation match the original vision?
  - Are there any gaps that need to be addressed in future work?

- **Quality Assessment:**
  - How robust is the implementation?
  - Are there adequate tests?
  - Is the code maintainable and well-documented?
  - Are there any technical debt items created?

- **User Impact:**
  - How will this change affect users?
  - Does it meet user needs effectively?
  - Were there any user experience considerations that emerged during implementation?

#### 2.2. Process Evaluation

- **Workflow Effectiveness:**
  - Did the planning workflow provide sufficient clarity?
  - Was the execution workflow efficient and helpful?
  - Did the GitHub issue structure support the work effectively?
  - How well did the team communicate and coordinate?

- **Technical Planning Quality:**
  - Was the technical plan comprehensive and accurate?
  - Did it identify the key challenges correctly?
  - Were the right packages/technologies chosen?
  - How could the technical planning be improved?

- **Estimation Accuracy:**
  - How accurate were the initial estimates?
  - What caused any significant variance?
  - What would help improve estimation in the future?

#### 2.3. Learning Capture

- **Technical Learnings:**
  - What new technical knowledge was gained?
  - Were there any surprising technical challenges?
  - What technical decisions worked well or didn't work?

- **Process Learnings:**
  - What workflow elements helped the most?
  - What communication approaches were effective?
  - What coordination challenges were encountered?

- **Collaboration Insights:**
  - How effective was the team collaboration?
  - What helped or hindered collaboration?
  - How effective was the AI assistance in this process?

#### 2.4. Improvement Ideas

- **Quick Wins:**
  - What simple changes could immediately improve the process?
  - Are there templates or checklists that could be created?
  - What tools or automations would help?

- **Workflow Refinements:**
  - How should the planning workflow be updated?
  - What changes are needed to the execution workflow?
  - How can the GitHub issue structure be enhanced?

- **Knowledge Sharing:**
  - What should be documented for future reference?
  - Who would benefit from these learnings?
  - How should this knowledge be shared?

### 3. Documenting the Reflection

Create a reflection document that captures the key insights:

```

1. **Update Workflow Documents:**
   - Modify planning, execution, or other workflow documents based on learnings
   - Update templates and checklists
   - Enhance GitHub issue structure guidelines

## Example Reflection Template

```
# Reflection Session: User Profile Export Feature (PROJ-123)

## Project Details
- Task: Implement user profile export functionality
- Timeline: March 1-15, 2023
- Contributors: Alex Kim, Jamie Smith
- Related PRs: #45, #48, #52

## Outcome Summary
- Successfully implemented PDF and CSV export
- All acceptance criteria met
- Performance within expected parameters
- One minor known issue with large exports (PROJ-130 created)

## What Went Well
- Package selection process:
  - The thorough package analysis led to selecting jsPDF, which worked perfectly
  - The comparison table approach saved time and led to the right decision
  - Recommendation: Continue using structured package evaluation

- Breaking down the work:
  - Creating sub-tickets for the UI, API, and export service worked well
  - Allowed parallel work and clear ownership
  - Recommendation: Continue breaking complex features into sub-tickets

## Challenges Faced
- Performance with large datasets:
  - Issue: Exports with >1000 records caused timeout issues
  - Resolution: Implemented chunking but needs further optimization
  - Prevention: Add performance testing with large datasets earlier in the process

- API Permission complexity:
  - Issue: Unexpected complexity in permission model delayed implementation
  - Resolution: Created middleware abstraction to handle permission checks
  - Prevention: Include permission architecture review in planning phase

## Process Evaluation
- Planning effectiveness: 4/5
  - Technical plan was comprehensive and mostly accurate
  - Package analysis was extremely valuable
  - Could improve by including performance requirements earlier

- Execution efficiency: 3/5
  - Progress tracking worked well
  - Some rework required due to late discovery of permission issues
  - Could improve by adding architecture review for cross-cutting concerns

- Communication: 5/5
  - Daily updates in the ticket were very helpful
  - Sub-ticket coordination was seamless
  - GitHub issue structure provided excellent clarity

## Key Learnings
- Technical:
  - PDF rendering in browser has significant performance implications
  - Streaming large datasets requires specific API design patterns

- Process:
  - The current state comment is very effective for visibility
  - Review of similar features in planning phase pays dividends

- Collaboration:
  - Clear interface contracts between sub-tickets enabled smooth integration
  - Early design review prevented UI rework

## Improvement Actions
- Immediate updates:
  - Add "Performance Considerations" section to technical plan template
  - Create reusable permission middleware pattern documentation

- Future enhancements:
  - Develop automated performance testing for data exports
  - Create package evaluation database for commonly used functionality

- Knowledge sharing:
  - Schedule tech talk on PDF generation best practices
  - Document the permission middleware approach in the wiki
```

## Reflection Review Cycle

To ensure continuous improvement:

1. **Revisit Previous Reflections:**
   - Before starting a new project, review relevant past reflections
   - Check if previous improvement suggestions were implemented
   - See if past challenges have been addressed

2. **Measure Improvement:**
   - Track if suggested improvements had the desired effect
   - Compare metrics before and after process changes
   - Gather feedback on workflow changes

3. **Meta-Reflection:**
   - Periodically review the reflection process itself
   - Adjust the reflection workflow based on experience
   - Ensure the reflection remains valuable and efficient

By consistently applying this reflection workflow, teams can build a culture of continuous improvement, capture institutional knowledge, and steadily enhance both their technical and process capabilities.
