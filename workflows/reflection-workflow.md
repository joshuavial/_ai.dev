# Reflection Workflow

This document outlines the process for conducting a thorough reflection upon task completion to capture learnings and improve future workflows.

For reference, see [Task Management Guidelines](../shared/task-management.md).

## When to Conduct Reflection

Reflection should be conducted:
- Upon completion of a significant feature
- At the end of a project milestone
- After addressing critical bugs
- When new approaches or technologies were used

## Reflection Process

### 1. Preparation

Before the reflection session:

- **Gather Artifacts:**
  - GitHub issues and history
  - Pull requests and review comments
  - Commit history
  - Documentation and metrics

- **Review Timeline:**
  - Initial estimates vs. actual time
  - Key decision points
  - Blockers encountered and resolutions

### 2. The Reflection Discussion

Structure the reflection around these key areas:

#### 2.1. Task Outcomes Review

- **Goal Achievement:** Were acceptance criteria met?
- **Quality Assessment:** Code quality, test coverage, maintainability
- **User Impact:** Effect on users, UX considerations

#### 2.2. Process Evaluation

- **Workflow Effectiveness:** Planning clarity, execution efficiency
- **Technical Planning Quality:** Accuracy of technical plan
- **Estimation Accuracy:** Variance analysis, improvement opportunities

#### 2.3. Learning Capture

- **Technical Learnings:** New knowledge, challenges, successful approaches
- **Process Learnings:** Workflow effectiveness, communication methods
- **Collaboration Insights:** Team effectiveness, AI assistance impact

#### 2.4. Improvement Ideas

- **Quick Wins:** Simple improvements, templates, automations
- **Workflow Refinements:** Updates to planning and execution workflows
- **Knowledge Sharing:** Documentation needs, knowledge transfer methods

### 3. Documenting the Reflection

Create a reflection document using this structure:

```
# Project Reflection: [Task/Feature Name]

## Project Overview
- Task ID: [PROJ-XXX]
- Description: [Brief description]
- Timeline: [Start date] to [End date]
- Team Members: [Names of contributors]

## Outcomes
- Completed deliverables: [List of deliverables]
- Open items: [Any pending items]
- Key metrics: [Any relevant metrics]

## What Went Well
- [Specific aspect that worked well]
  - Why: [Why this worked well]
  - How to replicate: [How to ensure this happens again]

## Challenges Encountered
- [Specific challenge]
  - Impact: [How it affected the project]
  - Resolution: [How it was resolved]
  - Prevention: [How to prevent this in future]

## Process Evaluation
- Planning effectiveness: [Rating and comments]
- Execution efficiency: [Rating and comments]
- Communication quality: [Rating and comments]
- Tool effectiveness: [Rating and comments]

## Key Learnings
- Technical: [Technical lessons learned]
- Process: [Process lessons learned]
- Collaboration: [Collaboration lessons learned]

## Improvement Actions
- Immediate actions: [Changes to implement now]
- Future enhancements: [Longer-term improvements]
- Knowledge sharing: [Plans for sharing these learnings]
```

### 4. Implementing Improvements

After reflection, prioritize and implement identified improvements:

1. **Update Workflow Documents:** Modify planning, execution, and other workflow documents
2. **Knowledge Sharing:** Schedule knowledge sharing sessions, update documentation
3. **Tool Improvements:** Implement automations, configure tools to better support the process
4. **Process Adjustments:** Update estimation approaches, refine task management

## AI-Assisted Reflection

When using AI tools to assist with reflection:

1. **Preparation Assistance:** AI can help gather and analyze artifacts
2. **Discussion Facilitation:** AI can identify patterns and suggest discussion points
3. **Documentation Generation:** AI can draft the reflection document
4. **Follow-up Actions:** AI can assist in updating workflow documents and tracking improvements

## Reflection Review Cycle

To ensure continuous improvement:

1. **Revisit Previous Reflections:** Review past reflections before starting new projects
2. **Measure Improvement:** Track the effect of implemented changes
3. **Meta-Reflection:** Periodically review and adjust the reflection process itself

By consistently applying this reflection workflow, teams can build a culture of continuous improvement and enhance both technical and process capabilities.
