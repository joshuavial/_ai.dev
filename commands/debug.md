Run the bug-investigator agent for systematic bug diagnosis and TDD-driven resolution.

The agent will:
1. Analyze bug reports and system symptoms
2. Perform systematic diagnostic investigation
3. Create reproducible test cases for the bug
4. Conduct root cause analysis using code tracing
5. Implement TDD-driven fixes with regression prevention
6. Generate comprehensive investigation documentation
7. Coordinate with manual-tester for UI bug reproduction
8. Ensure quality gates are met before resolution

Usage: When you need to investigate and resolve bugs, performance issues, or system errors with systematic methodology.
