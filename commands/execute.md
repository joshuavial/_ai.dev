Activate the execution-orchestrator agent for TDD-driven implementation.

The agent will:
1. Enforce strict RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycles
2. Coordinate code generation with pattern matching
3. Manage parallel component development
4. Ensure comprehensive test coverage
5. Validate implementation with manual testing

Usage: When implementing features from a technical plan.
