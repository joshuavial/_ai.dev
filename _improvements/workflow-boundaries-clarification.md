# Workflow Boundaries Clarification

## Issue Identified
The planning-orchestrator agent was attempting to start implementation work instead of stopping after creating the technical plan. This violated the workflow separation principle.

## Root Cause
The agent configuration didn't explicitly define workflow boundaries and handoff processes between planning and execution phases.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Planning-Orchestrator Updates
Added explicit boundaries section:
- **MUST NOT**: Start implementation, write code, or invoke execution
- **MUST**: Present plan for confirmation and suggest next step
- **Handoff**: Clear instructions to use `/execute` after plan approval

### 2. Execution-Orchestrator Updates
Added prerequisites section:
- Requires approved technical plan before starting
- Directs users to `/plan` if no plan exists

### 3. Clear Workflow Separation
Each orchestrator now:
- Stays within its workflow phase
- Provides clear handoff instructions
- Never automatically transitions to next phase

## Benefits
1. **User Control**: Users decide when to transition between phases
2. **Plan Review**: Ensures plans are reviewed before implementation
3. **Clear Boundaries**: No confusion about what each agent does
4. **Explicit Handoffs**: Clear instructions for next steps

## Workflow Pattern
```
User: /plan
→ Planning-Orchestrator creates plan
→ "Plan complete. Review at [location]. Run /execute to implement"
→ User reviews plan
User: /execute  
→ Execution-Orchestrator implements approved plan
→ "Implementation complete. Run /qa to verify"
→ User reviews implementation
User: /qa
→ QA-Orchestrator verifies quality
```

## Status
✅ Implemented - Agents updated with clear boundaries
