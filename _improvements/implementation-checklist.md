# Documentation Streamlining Implementation Checklist

**NOTE: This document serves as a tracking checklist for implementation progress.**

## Completed Tasks

### Core Instruction System
- [x] Create `_ai.bws/core-instructions.md` with unique identifiers
- [x] Implement [TYPE:CATEGORY-NN] format for instructions
- [x] Categorize instruction types (CRITICAL, REQUIREMENT, PROCESS, etc.)
- [x] Add implementation examples for each instruction type
- [x] Create cross-reference system for linking between instructions

### GitHub Issue Structure
- [x] Design minimalist GitHub issue format
- [x] Create KB-first approach documentation
- [x] Document bidirectional sync mechanism
- [x] Create `_ai.bws/github-issue-minimal.md`
- [x] Create `_ai.bws/kb-github-sync.md`
- [x] Create `_ai.bws/github-to-kb-sync.md`

### Boot Sequence Optimization
- [x] Design clean boot sequence
- [x] Create `_ai.bws/orientation-boot.md`
- [x] Create multi-agent structure in current.md
- [x] Create `_ai.bws/examples/current.md.multi-agent`
- [x] Eliminate workflow transition documentation

### Documentation Organization
- [x] Create `_ai.bws/_improvements` directory
- [x] Create initial documentation-streamlining-plan.md
- [x] Split plan into separate documents (overview, checklist, scratchpad)

## Upcoming Tasks

### Validate Core Instructions
- [ ] Test core instruction system with sample scenarios
- [ ] Verify cross-referencing works effectively
- [ ] Check for any gaps or inconsistencies
- [ ] Ensure all necessary instructions are captured

### Workflow Document Updates
- [ ] Update planning-workflow.md as pilot workflow
- [ ] Replace duplicated content with references to core instructions
- [ ] Ensure all planning-specific instructions remain
- [ ] Validate completeness against original document

### Remaining Workflow Documents
- [ ] Update execution-workflow.md
- [ ] Update qa-workflow.md
- [ ] Update reflection-workflow.md
- [ ] Update fast-track-workflow.md
- [ ] Update management-workflow.md
- [ ] Update shared documents:
  - [ ] github-issue-structure.md
  - [ ] boot.md
  - [ ] task-management.md
  - [ ] playwright-management.md

### CLAUDE.md Integration
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.template to reference core-instructions.md
- [ ] Remove duplicate content while maintaining clarity
- [ ] Develop guidelines for project-specific CLAUDE.md files

### Knowledge Base Implementation
- [ ] Define KB directory structure
- [ ] Create templates for KB documents
- [ ] Develop synchronization tools
- [ ] Document KB maintenance procedures

## Implementation Approach

We will follow an incremental approach:

1. [ ] Validate core instruction system first
2. [ ] Update one workflow as a pilot
3. [ ] Apply lessons learned to remaining workflows
4. [ ] Implement KB structure with templates
5. [ ] Test with real scenarios to validate effectiveness
