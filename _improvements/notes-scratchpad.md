# Documentation Streamlining Scratchpad

**NOTE: This document is for random notes, ideas, and brainstorming related to the documentation streamlining process.**

## Random Notes and Ideas

### Instruction Identifier Format

- [TYPE:CATEGORY-NN] seems most readable
- Could also consider:
  - TYPE-CATEGORY-NN
  - TYPE.CATEGORY.NN
  - TYPE_CATEGORY_NN
- Examples: [CRITICAL:WORKFLOW-01], [PROCESS:GIT-03]

### Possible Instruction Categories

- WORKFLOW - General workflow instructions
- GIT - Git and version control related
- DOCS - Documentation standards
- CODE - Code quality and standards
- REVIEW - Review process instructions
- PLANNING - Planning specific instructions
- EXECUTION - Execution specific instructions
- QA - Quality assurance instructions
- REFLECT - Reflection process instructions

### Possible Token Optimization Techniques

- Use reference links instead of embedding full content
- Create shorthand for common phrases
- Use JSON for structured data instead of prose
- Use numbered lists instead of paragraphs where possible
- Consider using emoji as visual shorthand for common concepts

### GitHub Issues Thread Structure

Current comment sequence:
1. Issue description
2. Current state comment (pinned)
3. Planning details
4. Execution updates
5. QA findings
6. Reflection notes

Potential optimized structure:
1. Issue description (with KB links only)
2. Current state comment (JSON format, pinned)
3. Status update comments (minimal, with KB links)

### Multi-Agent Considerations

- Need clear task boundaries between agents
- Consider using task IDs to prevent overlap
- Need mechanism for agents to "hand off" work
- Should standardize task status reporting format

### Knowledge Base Directory Structure Ideas

```
kb/
├── issues/
│   ├── issue-123/
│   │   ├── planning.md
│   │   ├── execution.md
│   │   ├── qa.md
│   │   └── reflection.md
│   └── issue-456/
├── templates/
│   ├── planning-template.md
│   ├── execution-template.md
│   └── ...
└── meta/
    ├── workflow-docs/
    └── process-improvements/
```

### Boot Sequence Optimization Thoughts

- Could use a JSON manifest that lists files to load in order
- Consider having different boot manifests for different tasks
- Might benefit from a "minimal boot" option for simple tasks
- Boot sequence could auto-detect task type and load only relevant docs

### Questions to Explore

- How should we handle historical issues that don't follow the new format?
- Should we create migration tools to update old issues?
- How do we handle project-specific vs. general instructions?
- What's the best way to version the instruction system?
- How should we handle instruction conflicts or updates?

### Token Usage by Document Type

Planning workflow: ~1800 tokens
Execution workflow: ~1500 tokens
QA workflow: ~900 tokens
Reflection workflow: ~800 tokens
Fast track workflow: ~750 tokens
Management workflow: ~650 tokens
Orientation process: ~1200 tokens

### Random Ideas to Investigate Later

- Consider creating a CLI tool for KB/GitHub synchronization
- Explore LLM-specific markdown extensions for better parsing
- Look into whether GitHub issue templates could be leveraged
- Consider developing a simple web UI for KB browsing
- Research if there are existing tools for similar documentation challenges
